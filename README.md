# Transporatation and weather alerts
The city of Boston has a well-documented API for its public transporatation, including up-to-date information on transportation alerts. 

## Summary: 
I choose this project because I wanted to work with a well-documented API that provided real-time updates with a dataset that I wan not familiar with before the project.

### Boston transportation
This is also the first ever API I've built, and I'm proud of the breadth of data I was able to work with. The MBTA has dozens (likely hundreds) of data end-points. After reading more about the dataset on the [City's Swagger page](https://api-v3.mbta.com/docs/swagger/index.html#/Alert/ApiWeb_AlertController_index), I realized that the `/alerts` endpoint would come with challenges, specifically finding how to build the correct path to get a general alert. After some trial and error, I was able to generate out the correct path for my purposes. 


### Weather
The other data component the weather API from the [National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api) to get an API that highlights up-to-date city and weather alerts for Boston.
