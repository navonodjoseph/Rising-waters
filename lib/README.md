# Transporatation and weather alerts
The city of Boston has a well-documented API for its public transporatation, including up-to-date information on transportation alerts. 

##Summary: 
I choose this project because I wanted to work with a well-documented API that provided real-time updates and wasn't as thoroughly discussed as some other transportation APIs. 

This is also the first ever API I've built, and I'm proud of the breadth of data I was able to work with. The MBTA has dozens of data end-points. After reading more about the dataset on the City's Swagger page, I realized that the /alerts endpoint would come with some challenges. More on that later. 

The other data component is weather. I used the comprehensive weather API from the National Weather Service to get  API that highlights up-to-date city and weather alerts for Boston.
